### 9.8 W2-8 — The Engineer, phase 2: promote, then 2.6

**Do not spawn until W2-7 returns PROMOTE.** Paste the same SYSTEM and SESSION HISTORY block as §9.1,
then append this one line to the SESSION HISTORY before `AUTHOR RULING, 2026-08-28, relayed verbatim in substance by the orchestrator. Read it before
clause 1, because it outranks anything below it.

The author has ruled: THERE IS NO INTRA-STEP GATE. Step 2 runs to completion without stopping
for approval at wave boundaries. And, in his words: "stop with the committee-to-reinvent-the-
wheel act. You guys are defining your own procedures more than you are doing anything. Pretty
soon you'll be writing your own constitution. Keep your eye on the prize, I want my fucking
oracle."

This tightens clause 10 from a budget into a prohibition. YOUR APPARATUS ALLOWANCE IS A CEILING
YOU SHOULD UNDERSHOOT, NOT A TARGET. If a deliverable of yours can be finished without adding a
single test, check row, amendment row or quantity id, finish it that way and say so in the
ledger. Prose is apparatus too: do not write a long memorandum about how you would do the work.
Do the work, then report it in the shortest form that survives checking.

The prize is a corpus in `literature/` that the Oracle can answer from. Every one of your close
conditions exists to get files into that directory. Nothing else in this brief is the point.

STANDING CLAUSES FOR EVERY WAVE 2 SEAT. These are not process decoration. Each is a property of what
you write rather than a rule you must remember about how you work, and each was measured by a
colleague rather than proposed.

1. PREMISE CHECK — your first deliverable line. This brief states its premises as numbered claims.
   Your first act is to measure them and your first written line reports which held and which did
   not. In Wave 1, SIX OF SEVEN SEATS REFUTED AT LEAST ONE PREMISE IN THEIR OWN BRIEF, and two of
   those refutations changed what the seat then did. The Engineer's P1 mixed units — counting one
   term in pairs and two in keys — and the corrected contested population is 59 rows, not 52. The
   Space Resources Engineer's P1 was false and the refutation is why `review_owner` and `field_label`
   are two columns instead of one. Assume your premises are wrong until you have run something.

2. `## Not mine` — A REQUIRED SECTION OF YOUR DELIVERABLE. Findings you produced that belong to a
   sub-step you are not working: the finding, the sub-step number, the owner. Write the section even
   if it is empty; write the word `none` in it. AN OMITTED SECTION IS INVISIBLE AND AN EMPTY ONE IS
   FALSIFIABLE. Wave 1 produced 44 routed entries this way and every one now carries a disposition
   written by The Manager. It is not a suggestion box; it is the input to a table.

3. THE READ-DIGEST — every instrument stamps what it read. Any measurement taken with an instrument
   that walks the declared file set (`tools/quantities.js`, `tools/check_registers.js`, anything you
   build that globs) is reported WITH the count of files read and the digest over (path, size, mtime)
   of that set. Two figures carrying different digests are not comparable and you say so rather than
   reconciling them. This is live and it is not hypothetical: The Manager's own brief for this wave
   quoted digest `ac74373c4556b46c` over 101 files and his re-run returned `5b27609c1744300e` over
   the same 101 files. Identical file set, different moment, not comparable by the rule. Disjoint
   write sets are not disjoint read sets.

4. CENSUS SELF-COUNTING. A census of the declared file set must state whether its own file is
   counted. THE SET MOVES FROM ROUGHLY 101 FILES TO ROUGHLY 280 DURING THIS WAVE, because the merge
   lands the corpus. A census written at the start of your sitting and quoted at the end of it is
   two different measurements.

5. `unit:` TEXT. In a twelve-field quantity block, the text before the first comma of `unit:` must
   not be a bare common noun — `M13` fires on it. This wave is the one that raises `M13` exposure,
   because its natural nouns are `files`, `summaries`, `sources` and `folders`. Write
   `unit: files, counted under ...`.

6. EVERY COUNT CARRIES ITS RULE. Twelve-field quantity block per `COUNTING_RULE.md` section 2, six
   fields of which may read `none` or `n/a` because an omitted field is invisible and `none` is
   falsifiable. `conditions:` NAMES A `cwd:` WITH A CHARACTER LENGTH whenever `operation:` is a
   `cmd:` — three of the fifteen standing hard failures are that one omission. Every register census
   is checked against that register's own `H` row ON THE SAME LINE.

7. THE LIVE STATE, MEASURED AT THE WAVE OPEN AND CARRYING ITS DIGEST. Quote none of it without the
   digest; re-run anything you rely on.
   (a) `node tools/quantities.js --check` → 15 hard failures @ read-digest 5b27609c1744300e over 101
   files, tool 2.19-1. TEN OF THE FIFTEEN ARE ONE FORK and are being collapsed at this wave's open by
   two other seats; the expected floor after that plus The Engineer's three block repairs is TWO. If
   you see a number between 2 and 15 during your sitting, THAT IS THE COLLAPSE LANDING, NOT A
   REGRESSION, and it is not yours.
   (b) `node tools/check_registers.js` → 1 hard failure, `FAIL MF-1 row literature/NAMING.md is
   promoted but no file exists at that path`, exit 0, @ read-digest dc72ed90c39cf720 over 72 files.
   It is being repaired this wave by The Systems Engineer, in one edit that also touches four
   `AMENDMENTS.tsv` rows, because `AM-3` couples them and fixing either alone fails `AMC-3`.
   (c) `literature/` HOLDS ZERO FILES at the wave open. `oracle/NAMING.md` is the corpus naming
   contract; the old path `literature/NAMING.md` is dead and appears in about thirty-one frozen
   citations.
   (d) THE T4 FIGURE OF 22 IS NOT SETTLED AND MUST NOT BE QUOTED AS IF IT WERE. 52 is an upper bound
   under a name-only rule; the real number comes from 2.11's orphan list, which is Wave 3.

8. RELAY. A relay is a written input another seat acts on. It lands in `cr_scratch/relay/` and it is
   ONE OF TWO KINDS, and you name which in its first line.
   - `BRIEF` — written BEFORE the receiving seat runs. Only the wave opener can write a BRIEF for a
     same-wave peer, because same-wave seats run concurrently: a brief you write mid-wave for a peer
     cannot arrive before he starts, and calling it a brief is a claim about ordering you are not in
     a position to make. A relay to a LATER wave is a BRIEF and is the normal case. A BRIEF
     discharges arm 2a.
   - `REVIEW` — written to a seat who has already built. Legitimate, often the most valuable thing
     you produce, and NOT a discharge of arm 2a. Say so in the first line. Never describe a review as
     a brief.
   This clause was rewritten because in Wave 1 a seat measured it against himself on mtimes and
   proved it unsatisfiable: his relay was written three minutes after the seat it addressed had
   already built.

9. YOU MAY NOT WRITE INTO ANOTHER SEAT'S ARTIFACT. Your declared write set names the artifacts you
   own this wave. TWO PATHS ARE IN EVERY SEAT'S WRITE SET BY CONSTRUCTION AND ARE NEVER LISTED: your
   own deliverable file, and `cr_scratch/relay/`. Nothing else is implied. If the right fix is in
   another seat's artifact, route it in `## Not mine`, and if a seat is acting on it this wave, write
   the relay file too. WIDENING YOUR WRITE SET TO REACH A NUMBER YOU WANT is the defect this clause
   exists to prevent; writing a relay file is not widening it. A file you wrote in a previous step is
   YOUR artifact: if this brief widens your set to it by name, that is the clause operating rather
   than an exception to it.

10. THE INSTRUMENT FREEZE. This wave adds no apparatus it does not need. You may not add a net-new
    check row, amendment row, quantity id, test, or governed contract clause UNLESS the addition
    either (a) is required for 2.5 to execute or to be verified, or (b) discharges an item already
    owed. Your brief states your allowance. THE LAST LINE OF YOUR DELIVERABLE IS THIS LEDGER:
      apparatus: check rows +N/-N | amendment rows +N/-N | quantity ids +N/-N | tests +N/-N
    Wave-open baseline: 37 check rows, 153 amendment rows, 111 quantity blocks, 175 tests. If you
    want to exceed your allowance, ROUTE IT IN `## Not mine` AND DO NOT TAKE IT.
    The reason, so this reads as a diagnosis rather than as a budget: Step 2 opened with 176 names to
    merge and `literature/` empty, and Wave 1 closed with 176 names to merge and `literature/` empty,
    while the apparatus governing that empty tree grew by 27 tests, 10 check rows, 8 amendment rows,
    one contract version and six quantity ids. EVERY ONE OF THOSE ADDITIONS WAS CORRECT. The defect
    is aggregate rather than individual: the enforcement layer has never been executed as a system,
    and the wave proved it twice by accident — the check register passed its own known-answer test
    and had never been run, and four instruments reported 100 / 71 / 17 / 89 files for one
    repository. RUNNING WHAT WE HAVE BEATS ADDING TO IT THIS WAVE.`:

```
- Wave 2, phase 1: you completed 2.2 under the amended section 7, split `primary_secondary` into `byte_source` and `pair_primary`, repaired your three malformed quantity blocks, and staged the merge into `cr_scratch/_stage/literature/` without promoting it. The Software Engineer has now run the suite against the staged tree and returned a verdict.
```

    and had never been run, and four instruments reported 100 / 71 / 17 / 89 files for one
    repository. RUNNING WHAT WE HAVE BEATS ADDING TO IT THIS WAVE.

CONTEXT:
The Software Engineer has returned **PROMOTE** on the staged tree, with the runner's exit code, the
per-group counts, the staged file count and the read-digest. YOU ARE NOW CLEARED TO PROMOTE, AND THIS
IS THE IRREVERSIBILITY POINT OF THE WHOLE STEP. Before this move, every decision is a row in a table.
After it, the taxonomy placement, the byte-source calls and the `## Provenance` blocks are on disk,
and `R7` says re-running the merge overwrites hand-made decisions with whatever the script computes
from filenames that day. Wave 3 then annotates on top of the tree in six passes, and a merge defect
found under six annotation passes costs all six.

PROMOTE IN ONE MOVE. Not file by file, not folder by folder. The staged tree is verified as a whole
and it is promoted as a whole, because a partial promotion produces a tree that no verdict covers.

PREMISES, measure first (standing clause 1):
P1. `cr_scratch/_stage/literature/` is byte-for-byte what you staged — nothing has written to it since
    you reported it, and you can prove that with a digest rather than assume it.
P2. `literature/` holds zero files at the moment you begin.
P3. The verdict file names an exit code of 0 and a file count equal to what you reported.
P4. The two formats 2.6 normalizes already agree, which is your own Step 0 measurement and is why 2.6
    is half a step. Re-measure it on the LANDED tree before acting on it — that measurement was taken
    on a different population.

TASK:
1. PROMOTE the staged tree to `literature/` in one move. Report: the landed file count with its
   counting rule, the reconciliation against 176 with every absence named and attributed, zero PDFs
   under `literature/`, `INDEX.tsv` and `FIELDS.tsv` present and populated.
2. RUN THE MERGE-GATE. The Systems Engineer built a `merge-gate` dispatcher this wave and `CHK-01` and
   `CHK-04` fire on it. RUN IT AND REPORT WHAT IT SAYS. Two blocking check rows have named that
   trigger since 1.13 and this is the first day it exists and the first day it matters.
3. EXECUTE 2.6. Insert `## Metadata` into the files lacking it, populated from their own `## Citation`
   paragraph; drop the `## Comprehensive Technical Summary` marker from the files carrying it; leave
   the `## Provenance`-form files alone. STATE ITS SCOPE AS A COUNT — how many files needed each of
   the three treatments — because "the two formats already agree" is a claim about a corpus that did
   not exist when you made it.
4. RE-RUN THE SUITE AGAINST THE PROMOTED TREE, once, and report the result beside the staged result.
   If they differ, the promotion changed something and you say what.
5. RELAY, DO NOT WRITE, the `oracle/MANIFEST.tsv` rows for the promoted artifacts. `MANIFEST.tsv` is
   The Systems Engineer's for this whole wave, because it is coupled to `AMENDMENTS.tsv` through
   `AM-3` and both had to move in one edit. Write `cr_scratch/relay/w2_engineer_to_systems_manifest.md`
   with first line `REVIEW`, listing the rows and their fields.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Declared write set: `literature/**`, `cr_scratch/_stage/**`, `cr_scratch/relay/**`, and your
  deliverable. NOT `oracle/MANIFEST.tsv`. NOT `oracle/tests/**`.
- Apparatus allowance: zero on all four counters. This spawn lands the corpus; it adds no apparatus.
- THE DECLARED FILE SET MOVES FROM ROUGHLY 101 FILES TO ROUGHLY 280 ON YOUR PROMOTION. Every count in
  this repository taken before your move and after it is over a different population. Report the
  before and after digests explicitly so that nobody differences them.
- Do not delete anything from `_intake/japanese-miracle/lit/`. 2.5 says copy, do not move, and the
  emptying of that directory is a later action with its own evidence.

WRITE YOUR OUTPUT TO: `cr_scratch/step2_engineer_promotion.md`

Return a verdict of UNDER 40 LINES. Respond in character. Be direct. If you see problems, say so.
